# todo-list-RN

A very simple To Do List App I made to get myself acquainted with React Native (using Expo).

Based on this tutorial: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/build-a-todo-list-app-using-react-native-526f8fe11ff1

I've added editing features and played a little w/ styling. 

To use it, just start a blank Expo project and replace the App.js code.
